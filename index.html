                  <h2>Where can I park?</h2>
                  <p>
                  Parking in Bellevue can be a daunting task.  In the Seattle Tacoma area in 2016, 68.3% of people commuted alone to work every day.  
                  This is over half of the population commuting and parking their cars with the median number of cars per household being 2 cars per family.
